# GammaBurstsProject-Hues
External requirement: 
- Chronux toolbox for Multi-taper analysis (http://chronux.org/; tested on version 2.00)

Steps:
1. Add */Matching Pursuit codes** and downloaded *Chronux toolbox* folders to path and run **runGetBurstLengthHueData_Analysis.m** to perform Spectral analyses. 
2. Run **GammaLength_HueData_Results_Fig2.m** to plot TF spectra and burst length distributions (for each HighRMSE electrode and also pooled across electrodes - Fig 1) for some hues.\n
3. Run **GammaLength_HueData_TFPlots_Fig1.m** to plot median burst lengths from different hues.
